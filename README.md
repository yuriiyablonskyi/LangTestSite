Language Proficiency Test Website
This repository contains a language proficiency testing website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features a Single Page Application (SPA) that enables dynamic interactions across 10 different pages. It is designed for language knowledge assessment and offers a user-friendly interface.

Features
SPA Architecture: The website employs a Single Page Application architecture to ensure a smooth and seamless user experience without page reloads.

Dynamic Interaction: Users can navigate through 10 different pages, each dedicated to a specific language test. The website dynamically updates content without the need for full page refresh.

Score Tracking: A modal displays the user's accumulated points and the percentage of correct answers. This provides instant feedback and encourages users to strive for better results.

Timer: The language test includes a timer feature. Once the timer reaches its limit, the test automatically concludes, and answers are evaluated.

Automatic Evaluation: Upon timer expiration or test completion, the user's answers are automatically evaluated. This streamlines the assessment process and provides immediate results.

Local Storage: Test results are stored locally in the browser's localStorage. This allows users to review their performance across sessions without losing data.
